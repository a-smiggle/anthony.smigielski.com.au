Source Code for my portfolio/blog.

# Tech Stack

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

# Why!

I have created this site as part of my journey to learn Front End development. With the combination of Nextail, its sample websites and this website I have learnt:
- React (Specifically using Next.JS)
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase

Learning this has taken three months of studying and practice. This journey in learning these was very enjoyable.

# What Next

I plan on furthering my React skills by creating more complex sites that I will post about here :grinning:.

## Skills to learn
- Prisma
- More Firebase
- More Vanilla CSS
- More React Fundamentals
